## Rationale

This framework was developed by Bloomberg after evaluating the [available alternatives](https://bloomberg.github.io/stricli/docs/getting-started/alternatives) and developing a set of [guiding principles](https://bloomberg.github.io/stricli/docs/getting-started/principles).

## Quick Start

Check out [the tutorial](https://bloomberg.github.io/stricli/docs/tutorial) to learn how to generate a new Stricli application.

## Building

Run `npm ci` to initialize the repo. We use Nx to manage tasks, so you can run the following to build it:

```
npx nx@latest run-many -t build
```

## Installation

The core Stricli framework is available on npmjs.com, and can be installed with the following command:

```
npm i -P @stricli/core
```
