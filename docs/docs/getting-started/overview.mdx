# Overview

**Stricli** is a zero-dependency framework for building complex, highly-featured CLIs in TypeScript.

Stricli was created despite an existing set of CLI frameworks in the JavaScript ecosystem. Bloomberg maintains several internal, user-facing CLIs written in TypeScript on top of Node.js using an assortment of existing frameworks and libraries. In the opinion of the authors of this framework, these existing frameworks and libraries suffer from some shortcomings and pain points that warranted an alternative solution. Check out the [alternatives considered](./alternatives) for a concrete breakdown.

The common issues with these alternatives can be reframed as a set of language-agnostic [guiding principles](./principles) that should be considered in addition to [clig.dev](https://clig.dev) when analyzing a CLI framework.
