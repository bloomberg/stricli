# Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is it called "stricli"?

The name is a combination of "strict" and CLI. Strict refers to the strict input parsing as well as the strict TypeScript type checking. This word was also chosen because it looks/sounds somewhat like the English word "strictly".

### What is the logo?

import StricliLogo from "../../static/img/S-logo.svg";

<StricliLogo width={64} height={64} />

The current Stricli logo is a combination of <span style={{ fontFamily: "Tourney", fontWeight: 900, fontSize: "1.5em" }}>s</span> (for Stricli) and <span style={{ fontFamily: "Tourney", fontWeight: 900, fontSize: "1.5em" }}>&gt;</span> to represent the terminal prompt. The specific <span style={{ fontFamily: "Tourney", fontWeight: 900, fontSize: "1.5em" }}>s</span> used in the logo is from the wonderful variable font <a href="https://github.com/Etcetera-Type-Co/Tourney" style={{ fontFamily: "Tourney", fontWeight: 900, fontSize: "1.25em" }}>Tourney</a> which is licensed under the [OFL](https://github.com/Etcetera-Type-Co/Tourney/blob/master/OFL.txt).
