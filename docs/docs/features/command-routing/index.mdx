# Command Routing

Applications are the top-level object that encapsulate all of the logic for a given CLI application. They can be built with a single [command](./commands.mdx) as the root or a [route map](./route-maps.mdx) of nested subcommands.

:::caution

If [version information](../configuration.mdx#version-information) is provided for an application with a single command as the root, then that command must not use the `--version` flag or the `-v` flag alias as those are reserved.

:::

When defining an application, there are several [configurations](../configuration.mdx) that should be specified (although all have default values).
