# Route Maps

For CLI applications with more than one command, route maps are the way to organize and nest these commands so that they are accessible to users. In order to create a new route map, call the `buildRouteMap` function with a mapping of route names to targets. The argument object for the builder accepts the following properties.

## Routes

The `routes` object is a simple mapping from route names to targets. The route names specified here are affected by the [scanner case style config](../configuration/input-scanning.mdx#scanner-case-style) when provided at runtime.

```ts
// output-next-line
/// commands.ts
const primaryCommand = ...
const altCommand = ...

buildRouteMap({
  routes: {
    primary: primaryCommand,
    alt: altCommand,
  },
  ...
});
```

When defining routes, a target can be any command or even another route map. When a route map is specified the usage line that is generated for the help text will list out the names of the sub-routes for that map as options.

```ts
// output-next-line
/// commands.ts
const itemActionsRouteMap = buildRouteMap({
  routes: {
    create: createItemCommand,
    rename: renameItemCommand,
    delete: deleteItemCommand,
  },
  ...
});

const root = buildRouteMap({
  routes: {
    login: loginCommand,
    item: itemActionsRouteMap,
  },
  ...
});
```

The route map configuration above will produce a command with the following behavior:

```sh
run --help
// output-start
USAGE
  run login
  run item create|rename|delete
  run --help

COMMANDS
  login  Login with auth credentials
  item   Actions that manipulate items
// output-end
run item --help
// output-start
USAGE
  run item create
  run item rename
  run item delete
  run item --help

Actions that manipulate items

COMMANDS
  create  Create a brand new item
  rename  Rename an existing item
  delete  Delete an item
// output-end
```

### Default Command

In some situations, particularly migrations, it can be useful to turn a single command into multiple commands. When a set of inputs resolve to a route map, the default behavior is to print the help text and discard any other inputs. With the `defaultCommand` configuration, all inputs that resolve to a route map instead invoke this default command. The default command must be registered as a route in that route map. This prevents the case where it becomes impossible to invoke a command with an argument that matches the name of another route.

Note that this means that all inputs that were considered invalid routes will now be passed as inputs to the default command.

```ts
buildRouteMap({
    routes: {
        foo: fooCommand,
        bar: buildRouteMap({
            routes: {
                old: oldBarCommand,
                new: newBarCommand,
            },
            defaultCommand: "old",
        }),
    },
});
```

The route map configuration above will produce a command with the following behavior:

```sh
run --help
// output-start
USAGE
  run foo
  run bar
  run --help
// output-end
run bar --help
// output-start
USAGE
  run bar old
  run bar new
  run bar --help
// output-end
run bar old
// output-start
OLD BAR COMMAND
// output-end
run bar new
// output-start
NEW BAR COMMAND
// output-end
run bar
// output-start
OLD BAR COMMAND
// output-end
```

### Aliases

For one reason or another, it may make sense to expose the same command multiple times under different names. Since the routes are defined by the route map, it is easy to just re-use the same target in multiple places. However, this option exists as an alternative that makes it easier to add aliases for a given route.

```ts
// output-next-line
/// commands.ts
buildRouteMap({
  routes: {
    open: openCommand,
    close: closeCommand,
  },
  aliases: {
    reopen: "open",
  },
  ...
});
```

The route map configuration above will produce a command with the following behavior:

```sh
run --help
// output-start
USAGE
  run open
  run close
  run --help

COMMANDS
  open   Open the connection
  close  Close the connection
// output-end
run open --help
// output-start
USAGE
  run open
  run open --help

Open the connection

ALIASES
  run reopen
// output-end
```

## Documentation

A base level of documentation is required, and more is always appreciated. All route maps must specify a value for `brief` that contains a short line of text to be used when referring to this route throughout the help text of the application.

Optionally, you can further customize the help text for this specific command by including `fullDescription`. This will override `brief` in the command's help text and can contain multiple lines of text rather than just one. There is also an additional `hideRoute` object that allows you to hide certain routes from showing up in documentation.

```ts
// output-next-line
/// commands.ts
buildRouteMap({
  docs: {
    brief: "This is a brief description of the routes",
    fullDescription: [
      "This is the full description of the routes.",
      "It should include all of the necessary details about the subcommands within.",
      "It will only be displayed to the user in the help text for this route.",
    ].join("\n"),
    hideRoute: {
      secret: true,
    },
  },
  ...
});
```

The command configuration above will produce a command with the following behavior:

```sh
run --help
// output-start
USAGE
  run subcommand1|subcommand2
  run --help

This is the full description of the routes.
It should include all of the necessary details about the subcommands within.
It will only be displayed to the user in the help text for this route.
// output-end
```
