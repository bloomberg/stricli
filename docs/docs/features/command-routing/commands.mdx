# Commands

Commands are the true building blocks of any CLI application. In order to create a new command, call the `buildCommand` function with the entire specification for that command's parameters and documentation. The argument object for the builder accepts the following properties.

## Implementation

### Lazy `loader`

The `loader` is a function that asynchronously returns a command module. The module should either be the command's implementation function or a default export of the same.

```ts
// output-next-line
/// impl.ts
export default function(flags: {}) {
  console.log("This is the primary function");
}

export function alt(flags: {}) {
  console.log("This is the alternative function");
}

// output-next-line
/// commands.ts
const primaryCommand = buildCommand({
  // highlight-next-line
  loader: async () => import("./impl"),
  ...
});

const altCommand = buildCommand({
  loader: async () => {
    // highlight-start
    const { alt } = await import("./impl");
    return alt;
    // highlight-end
  },
  ...
});
```

The asychronous nature of the loader is designed particularly for [dynamic import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import) expressions, so that the command can be defined and referenced when parsing/generating help text without loading the entire implementation. This also means that Stricli works well with bundlers that provide code splitting/async loading, and only the requested command's implementation is loaded at runtime.

### Direct `func`

If lazy loading is not desired, there is an option to co-locate the specification and the implementation into the same object. The `func` property is an alternative to `loader` should just be the implementation of the function.

```ts
// output-next-line
/// commands.ts
const command = buildCommand({
  // highlight-next-line
  func(flags: {}) {
    console.log("This is the inline function");
  },
  ...
});
```

## Parameters

The parameters object is a specification of all of the parameters (arguments and flags) that the command should accept. For more information about this specification, check out the section on [argument parsing](../argument-parsing).

## Documentation

A base level of documentation is required, and more is always appreciated. All commands must specify a value for `brief` that contains a short line of text to be used when referring to this command throughout the help text of the application.

Optionally, you can further customize the help text for this specific command by including `fullDescription` or `customUsage`. The former will override `brief` in the command's help text and can contain multiple lines of text rather than just one. The `customUsage` property will replace the auto-generated usage lines, and is useful when there's some [additional validation of user inputs](../out-of-scope.mdx#cross-argument-validation) that isn't represented natively by Stricli. You can also provide an object with `input` and `brief` to print a description after the usage line.

```ts
// output-next-line
/// command.ts
buildCommand({
  docs: {
    brief: "This is a brief description of the command",
    fullDescription: [
      "This is the full description of the command.",
      "It should include all of the necessary details about the behavior.",
      "It will only be displayed to the user in the help text for this command.",
    ].join("\n"),
    customUsage: [
      "-a -b",
      "-c",
      { input: "-d", brief: "Brief description of this use case" },
    ],
  },
  ...
});
```

The command configuration above will produce a command with the following behavior:

```sh
run --help
// output-start
USAGE
  run -a -b
  run -c
  run -d
    Brief description of this use case
  run --help

This is the full description of the command.
It should include all of the necessary details about the behavior.
It will only be displayed to the user in the help text for this command.
// output-end
```
