# Argument Parsing

Extending from our core principle of [When Parsing, Form Follows Function](../../getting-started/principles#when-parsing-form-follows-function), Stricli infers the shape of parameter definitions from the TypeScript types used in the implementation. This is achieved with some advanced conditional types that map the types of the parameters to the types of the parser specifications.

Stricli supports both [named flags](./flags) and [positional arguments](./positional) when defining parameters.
