# Shell Autocomplete

Stricli has first class support for tab auto completion in shells.

Rather than generate shell-specific scripts based on your application, the logic for proposing input completions is written directly into the core library. This means that the auto complete behavior will exactly match the functionality of your app.

## Autocomplete Management

Part of the difficulty with setting up auto completion is getting it installed into the shell. Stricli solves this with a standalone command `npx @stricli/auto-complete@latest`.

```
USAGE
  @stricli/auto-complete install [--shell bash] targetCmd autcCmd
  @stricli/auto-complete uninstall [--shell bash] targetCmd
  @stricli/auto-complete --help
  @stricli/auto-complete --version

Manage auto-complete command installations for shells

FLAGS
  -h --help     Print this help information and exit
  -v --version  Print version information and exit

COMMANDS
  install    Installs target command with autocompletion for a given shell type
  uninstall  Uninstalls target command for a given shell type
```

This command allows you to configure your shell to run a secondary `autcCmd` command whenever auto completion is requested for the `targetCmd` command.

:::caution

At this time, the only shell that `@stricli/auto-complete` supports is `bash`. Support for other shells is planned for the future.

### Adding a Built-In `install` Command

To simplify the process of installing the auto complete command, `@stricli/auto-complete` also exposes methods that allow you to build a command to be added to your own app. It is recommended to hide these so that they do not show up in any help text, but they can still be run. To see an example of this setup, check out the [quick start](../quick-start.mdx).
