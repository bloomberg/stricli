# Isolated Context

At the simplest level, command line applications require few external dependencies. They need to be able to write to `stdout` for console output and `stderr` for errors. For Stricli, these requirements are encapsulated in the [`CommandContext`](../../packages/core/interfaces/CommandContext) type.

It is a simple object that stores a `process` property that has `stdout`/`stderr` writable streams. This context is required when running the app, and is how Stricli prints help text and error messages to the console.

For Node or Node-compatible applications, this is as simple as passing `{ process }` or `globalThis` to `run`.

## Application Context

This object serves double duty as the context for the command and the application itself. There are some additional options that control the application's behavior. The first is `process.exit()` which allows Stricli to set the exit code of the application once the command finishes (or throws an error). The other is `locale` which is used by the [localization logic](configuration.mdx#localization) to determine which language the text should be in.

## Custom Data

The provided context is bound to `this` on the command's implementation function. You can choose to ignore this context completely and log with `console.log` or `console.error`. However, the context type can be customized which opens up some more options via dependency injection. You can define a custom context to store arbitrary data, which will then get passed through to your command.

```ts
// output-next-line
/// types.ts
interface User {
  readonly id: number;
  readonly name: string;
}

interface CustomContext extends CommandContext {
  readonly user?: User;
}

// output-next-line
/// impl.ts
export default function(this: CustomContext) {
  if (this.user) {
    this.process.stdout.write(`Logged in as ${this.user.name}`);
  } else {
    this.process.stdout.write(`Not logged in`);
  }
}

// output-next-line
/// run.ts
const user = ... // load user
await run(app, process.argv.slice(2), { process, user });
```

In this example, imagine that you store user information in the user's local environment. You can fetch that information and store it in the context for use in any/all of your commands.

The _real_ benefit of this pattern is being able to fully test the implementation functions by controlling all of their inputs and dependencies. Check out the [testing section](../testing.mdx) for more information on how to test your commands.
