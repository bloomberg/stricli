# Out of Scope

Stricli has a lot of features (see [Features](../category/features)) but it was not designed to solve every problem. It was deliberately created to have a limited feature set and then excel at those. The following features were all determined to be out-of-scope and are better solved manually or with an existing library.

## Cross-Argument Validation

Stricli derives the command line arguments from the functional arguments defined in the implementation. It was decided that the `flags` argument must be an object with static keys. This means that there are some flag types that can be represented in TypeScript but are not supported by Stricli.

```ts
export default function(flags: { alpha: number } | { beta: number; bravo: number }) { ...
```

This function accepts _either_ `{ alpha: number }` or `{ beta: number; bravo: number }` but not both simultaneously. There are some other CLI frameworks that support defining this kind of validation, but Stricli **does not** provide built-in support for this use case. Despite that, it is still possible to perform this validation manually. This may be a good use case for a third party runtime validation library like [`zod`](https://zod.dev/) or [`typanion`](https://mael.dev/typanion/).

```ts
import { z } from "zod";

const MyFlags = z.union([z.object({ alpha: z.number() }), z.object({ beta: z.number(), bravo: z.number() })]);

export default function (rawFlags: { alpha?: number; beta?: number; bravo?: number }) {
    const flags = MyFlags.parse(rawFlags);
}
```

## Local System Access

Command functions passed to Stricli can contain any sort of implementation. This means that an implementation can directly access any globals of the environment it is running in (ex: Node/Deno) as well as import other modules. While this is perfectly valid, the recommended best practice is to write command implementations with dependency injection via the [context](isolated-context.mdx) (bound to `this`) so that they are portable and testable.

As such, the local dependencies of a given command/application are not defined by Stricli and it is up to the application developer to define and supply them.

## Logging

Stricli has a very limited set of situations that rely in output printed to the console. As such, Stricli directly writes to stdout and stderr depending on the use case.

A fully featured logging solution is not simple to implement. Given that Stricli has no need for a logging solution directly, it does not provide one. However, developers are more than welcome to "bring your own" with any logging solution. As well, the `stdout` and `stderr` streams can be implemented indirectly by a logger if the intention is to capture all console output by the logger. Just provide alternative streams in the `context` object when invoking `run` and Stricli will write to those streams.

### Enhanced Formatting

For similar reasons to the lack of first-party logging support, Stricli does not provide enhanced formatting utilities. Consider the following third-party libraries if enhanced formatting is necessary for your application:

-   [`chalk`](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) - Terminal string styling done right
-   [`treeify`](https://github.com/notatestuser/treeify) - _treeify_ converts a JS object into a nice, visible depth-indented tree for console printing
-   [`ervy`](https://github.com/chunqiuyiyu/ervy) - Bring charts to terminal

## Prompting and `stdin`

The only end user input processed by Stricli is the `inputs` array of strings (derived from `argv` in Node). Many commands have no need for interactivity and the best method to achieve it is highly dependant on the environment. This is why `stdin` is not defined on the default context.

For end user interactivity during command execution, we would recommend [`enquirer`](https://github.com/enquirer/enquirer) for basic prompts.
