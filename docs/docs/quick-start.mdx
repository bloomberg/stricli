# Quick Start

This quick start guide will get you started with a new, empty Stricli application and show you how to modify it to suit your needs.

## Generate a New Node Application

If you have issues with this generator, please open an issue on [its source repo here](https://github.com/bloomberg/stricli/tree/main/packages/create-app).

### Step 1: `@stricli/create-app`

Run the following command.

```
npx @stricli/create-app@latest my-app
```

This command will create a new directory `my-app` and populate it with the boilerplate for a Stricli application. You can also pass the following options if you wish to customize the generated application.

```
FLAGS
     [--type]                              Package type, controls output format of JS files [commonjs|module, default = module]
     [--template]                          Application template to generate                 [single|multi, default = multi]
     [--auto-complete/--no-auto-complete]  Include auto complete postinstall script         [default = true]
  -n [--name]                              Package name, if different from directory
     [--command]                           Intended bin command, if different from name
  -d [--description]                       Package description                              [default = Stricli command line application]
     [--license]                           Package license                                  [default = MIT]
     [--author]                            Package author                                   [default = ""]
  -h  --help                               Print help information and exit
  -v  --version                            Print version information and exit

ARGUMENTS
  path  Target path of new package directory
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

The generated application will only contain `package.json`. To actually install the declared dependencies, `cd` to that directory and run `npm install --ignore-scripts`. The ignore is needed when using `--auto-complete` (enabled by default) as it adds a `postinstall` script to install the auto complete functionality.

### Step 3: Build application

The boilerplate includes a `build` script that invokes [`tsup`](https://tsup.egoist.dev/). Note that this tool uses [`esbuild`](https://esbuild.github.io/) to compile the project to a single output file and it [will not perform type checking by default](https://tsup.egoist.dev/#what-about-type-checking).

### Step 4: Test the output

Stricli applications can be executed directly in source, or in a separate script. This template generates a `src/bin/cli.ts` file to invoke `run` so that the rest of the source only contains exports without side-effects. Try running your new app by calling the compiled bin script at `dist/cli.js` with `--help`.

```sh
dist/cli.js --help
// output-start
USAGE
  my-app subdir
  my-app nested foo|bar ...
  my-app --help
  my-app --version

Stricli command line application

FLAGS
  -h --help     Print this help information and exit
  -v --version  Print version information and exit

COMMANDS
  subdir  Command in subdirectory
  nested  Nested commands
// output-end
dist/cli.js nested --help
// output-start
USAGE
  my-app nested foo
  my-app nested bar
  my-app nested --help

Nested commands

FLAGS
  -h --help  Print this help information and exit

COMMANDS
  foo  Nested foo command
  bar  Nested bar command
// output-end
```

You should see this exact output if you generated a multi-command app. Since Stricli applications are all defined in code, you can keep this file layout or move the files/declarations around as you want. Just be aware that everything except the `impl.ts` files will be loaded synchronously on app load, so be mindful of what you import and where.

#### Single Command

You can optionally choose to run `npx @stricli/create-app@latest --template single` to generate a single command app.

If you generated a single command app, your initial output should look like this:

```sh
dist/cli.js --help
// output-start
USAGE
  my-app --count value arg1
  my-app --help
  my-app --version

Stricli command line application

FLAGS
     --count    Number of times to say hello
  -h --help     Print this help information and exit
  -v --version  Print version information and exit

ARGUMENTS
  arg1  Your name
// output-end
```

If you see that output, you have successfully generated a new Stricli application!

```sh
dist/cli.js World --count 3
// output-start
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
// output-end
```
